# GUI-for-Hotel
Welcome to our first GUI project using Python Tkinter! ðŸŽ‰ Get ready to dive into the world of creating a user-friendly interface for a hotel menu, order management, and bill generation. Here's what you can expect from our project:

Menu Display: We have a variety of mouthwatering dishes listed in text files, neatly organized in the 'Menu' folder. You can browse through the menu by category to find your favorite items.
Order Management: Once you've selected your desired items, they will be displayed in the order frame. From there, you can easily add, remove, or update the quantity of items to customize your order exactly how you like it.
Customer Details: Before finalizing your order, we'll need some basic information from you. Don't worry, it's just to ensure smooth processing and to keep track of your order history.
Bill Generation: After selecting at least one item, you can generate your bill with just a click of a button. Your bill will be displayed in a new window for your convenience, and a copy will be saved in the 'Bill Records' folder for future reference.
Order Cancellation: Changed your mind about an item? No problem! You can easily cancel or modify your order before generating the bill.
We've utilized Python dictionaries for temporary storage of your order details, while text files handle permanent storage of the menu items and bills along with customer information.

So get ready to embark on this exciting journey with us, where delicious food meets seamless user experience! Let's create unforgettable moments, one order at a time.
